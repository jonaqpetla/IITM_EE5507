# IITM_EE5507
Codes required for EE5507 - RF Systems Lab. Feel free to use these in your own experiments.

## Folder 1: VNA Calibration using SOLT method.
The provided codes are meant for use along with Mini Circuits UVNA-63 VNA kit. The codes load and manipulate .csv files as output by the VNA (and not on .s2p touchstone files as would be expected from a commercial VNA).

## Folder 2: 3D mmWave Imaging Kit
The provided codes do something, I think.
